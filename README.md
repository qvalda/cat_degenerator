# Convolutional GAN for generating cat faces

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are neural network architectures that use two networks (generator and discriminator), working one against the other (“adversarial”) in order to generate new, artificial instances of data that can pass for real data. They are used widely in image generation and voice generation.

In this example I have used 2000 grayscale cat faces , extracted from the Kaggle Cats & Dogs dataset with OpenCV, size of 64x64 pixels.
